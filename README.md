# Local-webserver-for-my-room
this program was written with the intention of running it on a rasberry pie
the program has three points of functionality: 
controlling the lights in my room using the yeelight python library, 
playing music through a speaker I connect to a raspberry pie
and setting an alarm to wake me up in the morning 

*note* the audio of the music player and alarm play through the device running the webserver so that requests made from other devices
still play music through the speaker conncected to the rasberry pie.
